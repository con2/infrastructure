# Ansible role for a dockerized AtlaSSO

[AtlaSSO](https://github.com/tracon/kompassi-atlasso) is a solution to a somewhat Tracon-specific problem: we want Atlassian apps in the \*.tracon.fi domain to do SSO through an application in the kompassi.eu domain. Basically an OAuth2 to Crowd SSO adapter.
